Basic app - console for MRE platform mobile phone (including Nokia S30+). If exist text file "Mrecp.txt" on same directory as app file "Mrecp.vxp",
first text line  from "Mrecp.txt" will be used as autostart command (if changing app name change default text file name). Tested on Nokia 225 with display resolution 240x320. 
For using with Nokia mobile phone, app must be signed with IMSI (your SIM card) code.
